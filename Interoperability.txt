Skype |
-------

  * The Windows Skype client supports using both D&D and C&P to export contact list items

  * Contacts exported via D&D have the following MIME types associated with them:
 
     SkypeIdentityList | VCard | DragImageBits | DragContext

SkypeIdentityList |
-------------------

  * This consists of UTF-16 text, prefixed with a length byte and padding.

  * A codec for this format (which supports decoding only) is implemented in 
     Skype::ParseClipboardData() in /Parsers/skype.cpp.

   00000000  07 00 00 00  65 00 63 00  ....e.c.

   00000008  68 00 6F 00  31 00 32 00  h.o.1.2.
   00000010  33 00                     3.

VCard |
-------

  * This format is currently unimplemented in SocialClient.

  * This appears to be a standard, ASCII/UTF-8-encoded vCard 3.0 document,
     containing the following elements:

     * BEGIN      
     * VERSION
     * N
     * X-SKYPE-USERNAME
     * FN
     * X-SKYPE-DISPLAYNAME
     * X-SKYPE-LANGUAGE
     * URL
     * NOTE
     * REV
     * END

Contact List/Accounts Data |
----------------------------

Pidgin |
--------

  * The Windows version doesn't seem to support using D&D (or the clipboard) to export contact
     data elsewhere.
 
  * The Linux version supports both D&D and C&P of accounts and contact list items
